<h4>
    Responsive grid
</h4>

<p>
    The page editor uses a drag-and-drop grid layout. Simply grab text, images and other blocks to move them around.
</p>

<p>
    Drag the grey bars between blocks to resize each cell in the grid. Try it now if you like (don't worry, you
    can cancel your changes later).
